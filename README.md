Photo Scavenger Hunt is an app that lets the user choose one of the hunts that are not found yet. They can then submit a photo from their photo library where the phone will ask access to their photo library. The photo will show up on a map based on the location it was taken.

## Notes

While creating this app I had a lot of trouble with the Stack View layouts on the storyboard interface. I did not understand the constraints and the whole layout would get messed up if I changed one thing. It was very frustrating but in the end it ended up fine.
